# 16-bit-assembly

I studied the 16-bit Assembly language.
* prbl1, prbl2 -> implemented basic mathematical operations using mov, add, adc, sub, sbb, cbw, imul, idiv
* setA, setB, 2A_instr, 2B_instr, 2A, 2B -> manipulating string using flags and loops
* pb -> working with bytes using and, or, shl, shr
* prbl2_5 -> interrupts
